## About Me
I am a software engineer with a strong background in machine learning, computer vision, and time-series modeling, as well as hands-on experience in embedded systems and modem technologies. My career goal is to develop secure, reliable, and robust AI-enabled systems that tightly integrate sensing, decision-making, and actuation, particularly in safety-critical and resource-constrained environments.
