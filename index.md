# Hsiao-Ting Huang
Software Engineer @ MediaTek · M.S. ECE (University of Washington)  
Interests: AI Security, Cyber-Physical Systems, Trustworthy ML, Embedded Systems

## Selected Projects & Results
- Dense Video Captioning (PDVC) — **Top 3**, UW ECE Capstone

- Privacy-Preserving ML — **ACM/IMS Transactions on Data Science** (co-author)  
- 4G/5G Embedded Systems — MediaTek modem features (real-world constraints & optimization)

## What I'm Building Next (2025)
- CPS adversarial sensing simulation (robust perception under perturbations)
- LLM jailbreak mini-benchmark (attack success vs. utility trade-off)  
*(I’ll keep this page updated with code and reports.)*

## About
I aim to secure AI-enabled systems that couple sensing, decision-making, and actuation.
